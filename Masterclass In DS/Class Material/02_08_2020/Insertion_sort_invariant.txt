a[0] to a[j-1] is sorted 

Pre: Unsorted 

  
    for(j = 1; j < n; ++j){

    } 
    after incrementing j
    condition a[0] to a[j-1] sorted

Post: sorted


Before start of every iteration 
a[0] to a[j-1] MUST BE SORTED 

j = 1 a[0] to a[0]

j = n a[0] to a[n-1] is sorted = post condition 


Invariant condition maintained by a loop. 

[1] Before the start of first iteration, 
the condition should be true. 

[2] Before start of ANY arbitrary iteration 
(not first, not last), the condition should be true 

[3] At the end of looping process, the condition should be true

------------------------------------------------------------------
Invariant: a[0] to a[j-1] is sorted 

First: j = 1 

a[0] to a[0] is sorted. 

At the start of every iteration the condition holds true. 

At the end of the looping process, j = n, a[0] to a[n-1]
i.e. entire array is sorted.
