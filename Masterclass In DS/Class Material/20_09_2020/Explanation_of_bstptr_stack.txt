struct node{
	int data;
	struct node* prev; 
	struct node* next; 
}; 

struct bst_node{
	int data; 
	struct bst_node* left, *right, *parent; 
}; 

If there are N elements in BST then there are N nodes of 
type struct bst_node. 

While traversing through the BST, if I want to save current 
node's address onto the stack then I will need a stack of 
bst_node_t* 

struct bstptr_node{
	struct bst_node* p; 
	int color; 

	struct bstptr_node* prev, *next; 
}; // -> Doubly circular linked list -> stack
