LHS = RHS

RHS = expression
LHS = variable name

[1] Evaluate RHS expression. It will yield an object  of some type.
    Object may be previously present in pool or it may be allocated
    freshly.

[2] Check if LHS is present or not.
    [A] NO ----> STOP
    [B] YES
        [a] Check the symbol table for LHS variable name
        [b] Is it present
            (i) NO:
                -Create a new symbol table entry for current
                variable name and bind the address yield by RHS object
                with it.
                -Increment the reference count of object yield by
                RHS by 1
            (ii) YES:
                - Mark existing object in symbol table as 'old' and
                object yield by RHS as 'current'
                - Replace the id of 'old' object by 'current' object
                - Decrement reference count of 'old' object by 1
                - Increment reference count of 'current' object by 1

Evaluating RHS expression:
    [A] If  literal expression is encountered then nothing to be done
    [B] If variable name is name encountered
            Look up into symbol table for variable name
            Not present:
                raise NameError exception
            Present:
                Go to object whose address is present in symbol table
                Get the value.
